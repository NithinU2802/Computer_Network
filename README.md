# Here the program is consist of two class one is for server and other is for client Now to run this project we need 
to know that what are the files available in the package further we need to setup configure with three devicen Now lets 
get into learning and then move on to the implementation process further we plan to make any Update...! 


    # Learn Technology Used --> Learn Code --> Implementation  --> Plan to make Updation 



    Learning Sockets:
             An Socket is an package available in java inorder to make communication between two Nodes...!
             Sockets are used for connection oriented programming and also has connectionless programming...
      A socket is one endpoint of a two-way Communicationlink between two programs running on the network. The 
Socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application taht data is destined to
be sent.

                                Server   <------------> Client 
                                 port      connection    port

      
      Some of the Important Methods of Socket and Socket Server: 
                        public InputStream getInputStream()    -    Returns the InputStream attached with this socket.
                        Public OutputStream getOutputStream()  -    Return the OutpputStream attached with this socket. 
                        public synchronized void close()       -    Closes this Socket
                        public socket accept()                 -    Returns the socket and establish a connection between client and server
                        public synchronized void close()       -    Closes the server socket

            Depends on the IP address and port number we can provide communication between two end of the
network available in a group..!

Project Configuration: 
      # JMF - Java Media File  (Install it form oracle website)
                jmf is used to access the media port in the system. Which is an collections of packages an library to 
access the sensors or devices available in the local machine...!
      # Also Make sure that Java JDK is available in Your system...!
